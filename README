This project provided an opportunity to learn about control system and how much effort is needed to achieve a 6 degree of freedom motion for a non-linear aerodynamic aerial vehicle. Use of mathematical Modelling to understand the dynamics of the system and after experimenting with different types of controller came up with the use of mpc controller as the most suitable.
